# credit-risk-scoring
Credit Path AI is a machine learning–powered credit risk analysis system designed to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to repay or default based on financial and demographic data. The project demonstrates how AI can be applied in the fintech domain to support smarter lending decisions, reduce financial risk,.

🎯 Objectives

Predict the probability of loan default using historical borrower data.

Compare machine learning models to find the most accurate and robust approach.

Provide explainable insights to support transparent and fair loan decisions.

Improve baseline rule-based assessment using data-driven ML techniques.

🧠 Key Features

✔ Data preprocessing pipeline (encoding, normalization, missing value handling)
✔ Feature selection and feature engineering
✔ Multiple ML models tested and evaluated
✔ ROC–AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score performance comparison
✔ Model interpretability via confusion matrix and classification metrics
✔ Exportable trained model for deployment or integration

Evaluation Metrics

To ensure fair and reliable prediction, the project uses several metrics:

Accuracy

Recall (important for fraud/loan risk)

Precision

F1-Score

ROC–AUC Curve Visualization



🚀 Future Improvements

🔹 Web or API deployment using Flask / FastAPI
🔹 SHAP / LIME explainability for regulatory compliance
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna or GridSearch
🔹 Connect to live fintech datasets for real-world validation
